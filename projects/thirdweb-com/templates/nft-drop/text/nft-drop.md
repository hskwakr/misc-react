# NFT Drop

In this example, you'll learn how to create a website where mint your NFTs!

We'll show you how to:

- Batch upload your NFTs from a `.csv` file or a `.json` file to lazy-mint all your NFTs.

- Set claim conditions, such as an allowlist, a limit on mints per wallet, and a release date.

- Create a custom NFT minting page for your users to mint NFTs from your drop.

## Demo

In the end, you'll have a production-ready NFT Drop that your users can mint from!

You can test out the demo deployment here: [https://custom-minting-page.thirdweb-example.com](https://custom-minting-page.thirdweb-example.com)

## Process

We'll run you through the process of:

1. creating your NFTs using our NFT Drop contract and configuring your claim phases.

2. integrating the SDK into your application.

3. customizing the NFT Drop page to match your brand.
