- Configure the metadata such as the name, image, description, and fees of the Marketplace.

To create a Marketplace contract, head to the dashboard and connect your wallet.

Then click on the Deploy New Contract button.

Select Marketplace from the list of contracts and click Deploy Now.

Before deploying it, you can configure the contract's Name, Symbol, and Description.
