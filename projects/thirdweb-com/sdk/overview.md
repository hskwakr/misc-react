# Overview

Our SKDs enable you to build web3 applications, with capabilities such as:

- Connecting to user's wallets
- Deploying and interacting with smart contracts
- Utilizing the extensions you implemented in Solidity

We support the most popular languages (and are working on more) to make it easier for you to build different kinds of applications.

- JavaScript
- React
- Python
- Go

## Quick Start

Set up a new web application with the React and JavaScript SDKs set up using the CLI.

```console
npx thirdweb create --app
```

Start with a basic configuration with the language and framework of your choice, or choose one of our templates to get a headstart by passing the `--template` flag and the name of a template repository.

## Using the SDK

Depending on the type of application you want to build, we've separated the getting started flow into two pages.

1. Frontend Applications: Web-applications that connect to users' wallets to let them interact with smartcontracts.

2. Backedn & Scripting: Use your own wallet to interact with smart contracts.
